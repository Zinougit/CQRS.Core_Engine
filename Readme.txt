CQRS Engine is a class library designed to provide a structured and reusable framework for implementing the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern in microservices. It defines a set of interfaces and abstract classes that standardize and streamline the implementation of the CQRS architecture across different microservices.

#Features

Separation of Concerns: Clearly separates read and write operations for better scalability and maintainability.
Abstraction Layer: Provides abstract classes and interfaces to enforce a consistent implementation in microservices.
Reusability: Simplifies the development process by offering a reusable library that eliminates repetitive boilerplate code.
Extensibility: Designed to be flexible and extensible to suit various microservice requirements.
